# Personal Capital Custom Assets

[Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) is a financial tool to help you with your networth and financial accounts similar to [Mint](https://www.mint.com/).  There are some accounts though that you can't setup like Robinhood or Crypto Addresses.  This personal project is my attempt of updating custom assets on a regular basis so I'm always aware of my financial health.

### Environment Variables
`BITCOIN_ADDRESS` - your bitcoin address

`ETHER_ADDRESS` - your ether address

`LITECOIN_ADDRESS` - your litecoin address

`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` - your https://etherscan.io/ api-key
